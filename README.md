AI for Equitable Healthcare

## 1. Project Title

Arogya Mithra – AI-Assisted Rural Healthcare Support Platform

## 2. Overview

Arogya Mithra is an AI-assisted, role-based healthcare platform designed to reduce urban–rural healthcare inequality by supporting patients, frontline health workers (ASHA/ANM), doctors, and public health officials.

The platform enables early symptom triage, telemedicine prioritization, and public health intelligence, ensuring healthcare delivery is accessible, affordable, data-driven, and ethical.

## 3. Intended Use & Medical Disclaimer

Intended Use:
To assist healthcare delivery through decision support for:
Early risk identification
Telemedicine prioritization
Frontline health worker guidance
Public health monitoring

Medical Disclaimer:
This system does not provide medical diagnosis or treatment.
All AI outputs are assistive only, and final clinical decisions rest with qualified healthcare professionals.

## 4. Data Source

Public health datasets (Kaggle, Government Open Data, WHO)
Symptom-based datasets for triage modeling
Mock data used where live integration is not feasible
All data usage follows privacy-first and consent-based principles.

## 5. Regulatory & Ethical Alignment

Human-in-the-loop AI design
Explainable and interpretable ML models
Role-based access control
No automated diagnosis or prescriptions
Designed to align with responsible AI and public healthcare workflows

## 6. Usage & Benefits
How It Is Used
Patients or ASHA workers enter symptoms
AI classifies risk (Low / Medium / High)
Care is guided to home monitoring, teleconsultation, or referral
Doctors receive AI-prioritized consultation queues
Health officials monitor disease trends and risks

 Key Benefits

Reduced delayed diagnosis in rural areas
Optimized telemedicine workflows
Empowered frontline health workers
Data-driven public health decision-making

## 7. Tools & Technologies

Frontend: Antigravity Web UI
Backend: Firebase Authentication, Firestore
AI/ML: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Design Focus: Explainability, scalability, ethical AI

## 8.Final Contribution

Arogya Mithra presents a practical implementation of an AI-powered multilingual symptom triage and referral system designed to support rural frontline health workers in identifying high-risk patients and prioritizing teleconsultations.

The project demonstrates how simple, explainable, and ethically designed AI can be integrated into real-world healthcare workflows to improve accessibility, reduce delays in care, and optimize the use of limited medical expertise. By assisting patients, health workers, doctors, and public health officials through role-based decision support, the system strengthens healthcare delivery without replacing clinical judgment.

This work highlights the potential of responsible, data-driven AI to advance equitable healthcare outcomes in underserved communities.
