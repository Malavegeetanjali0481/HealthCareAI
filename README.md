AI for Equitable Healthcare

## 1. Project Title

Arogya Mithra – AI-Assisted Rural Healthcare Support Platform

## 2. Overview

Arogya Mithra is an AI-assisted, role-based healthcare platform designed to reduce urban–rural healthcare inequality by supporting patients, frontline health workers (ASHA/ANM), doctors, and public health officials.

The platform enables early symptom triage, telemedicine prioritization, and public health intelligence, ensuring healthcare delivery is accessible, affordable, data-driven, and ethical.

## 3.Workflow
Access the Application
Open the Arogya Mithra web application and select Login / Register.

Role Selection and Login
Log in as one of the following roles:
<ul>
<li> Patient</li>
  <li>Asha Worker</li>
  <li>Doctor</li>
  <li>District Officer</li>
</ul>

Symptom Assessment (Patient / Health Worker)
Enter symptoms and basic details, then submit for AI-assisted analysis.
The system displays a risk level (Low, Medium, High) with recommended next steps.

Care Guidance and Referral
Based on the assessed risk, the user is guided toward home monitoring, teleconsultation, or referral.

Telemedicine Consultation (Doctor)
Doctors access an AI-prioritized patient queue, review case summaries, and conduct consultations.
Clinical decisions are made by the doctor.

Public Health Monitoring (Admin)
Administrators review aggregated data to monitor disease trends and regional health risks.

Follow-Up and History
Users can review previous assessments, consultations, and follow-up records for continuity of care.

## 4. Data Source

Public health datasets (Kaggle, Government Open Data, WHO)

Symptom-based datasets for triage modeling

Mock data used where live integration is not feasible

All data usage follows privacy-first and consent-based principles.

## 5. Regulatory & Ethical Alignment

Human-in-the-loop AI design

Explainable and interpretable ML models

Role-based access control

No automated diagnosis or prescriptions

Designed to align with responsible AI and public healthcare workflows

## 6. Usage & Benefits
How It Is Used
Patients or ASHA workers enter symptoms
AI classifies risk (Low / Medium / High)
Care is guided to home monitoring, teleconsultation, or referral
Doctors receive AI-prioritized consultation queues
Health officials monitor disease trends and risks

 Key Benefits

Reduced delayed diagnosis in rural areas
Optimized telemedicine workflows
Empowered frontline health workers
Data-driven public health decision-making

## 7. Tools & Technologies

Frontend: Antigravity Web UI

Backend: Firebase Authentication, Firestore

AI/ML: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Design Focus: Explainability, scalability, ethical AI

## 8 .Final Contribution

Arogya Mithra presents a practical implementation of an AI-powered multilingual symptom triage and referral system designed to support rural frontline health workers in identifying high-risk patients and prioritizing teleconsultations.

The project demonstrates how simple, explainable, and ethically designed AI can be integrated into real-world healthcare workflows to improve accessibility, reduce delays in care, and optimize the use of limited medical expertise. By assisting patients, health workers, doctors, and public health officials through role-based decision support, the system strengthens healthcare delivery without replacing clinical judgment.

This work highlights the potential of responsible, data-driven AI to advance equitable healthcare outcomes in underserved communities.
